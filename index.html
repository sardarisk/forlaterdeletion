                The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is
                most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an
                apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and
                generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its
                requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two
                years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

            <p>The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin, and in
              the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands. Since the early 20th century,
              tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and
              Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China.
              Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical
              forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra.</p>

            <p>The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986. As of 2015, the global wild tiger
              population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, down from around 100,000 at
              the start of the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from
              each other. Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and
              poaching. This, coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more densely populated places on Earth,
              has caused significant conflicts with humans.</p>

            <p>The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It featured
              prominently in ancient mythology and folklore and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature,
              appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal
              of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea. </p>
              <p>Following Linnaeus's first descriptions of the species, several tiger specimens were described and proposed as subspecies.[12] The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999. Most putative subspecies described in the 19th and 20th centuries were distinguished on basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size, hence characteristics that vary widely within populations. Morphologically, tigers from different regions vary little, and gene flow between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the Pleistocene. Therefore, it was proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P. t. tigris in mainland Asia, and P. t. sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands</p>
